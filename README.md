## Project Overview

This data analysis project examines the effectiveness of different drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. The study focuses on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth across 249 mice treated with various drug regimens over a 45-day period.

## Key Findings

- **Capomulin and Ramicane** were the most effective treatments in reducing tumor volume
- There is a **strong positive correlation (0.84)** between mouse weight and tumor volume
- Most drug regimens had mouse deaths throughout the study, with the exception of Capomulin and Ramicane
- One mouse in the Infubinol regimen showed tumor reduction while others showed growth, suggesting a potential outlier or individualized response

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical Analysis
